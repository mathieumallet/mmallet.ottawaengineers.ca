    <p> What does Mathieu know? This question can be divided between the things I have learned though my university education and the things I have learned about during my spare time. </p>

    <h3><a name="formaled"></a>Formal Education</h3>
    <p> From 1999 to 2003, I have attended classes at the University of Ottawa. During those four and a half years, I have acquired a baccalaureate of applied sciences in computer engineering. I also had the chance of participating in the cooperative education program: this allowed me to gain work experience as I was studying. I graduated on december 2003 with High Honors. </p>
    <h3><a name="classes"></a>Overview of Classes </h3>
    <p> My studies at the University of Ottawa touched a wide array of disciplines. Following are a few of those classes and what they have given me.</p>
    <p>Electronics and computer design. Analog and digital circuit design. Integrated chips design and programmation. Systems design and robotics. If it uses current, I've probably worked with it.</p>
    <p>Programming classes. From C++ and Java to data structures and finishing with software design, I have learned a great deal about the workings of software.</p>
    <p>Signals and communications. I have taken a wide range of information theory classes such as telecommunications, digital signal processing and image processing classes.</p>
    <p>A solid math background. I have followed, during my years at ottawa, a wide range of mathematical classes ranging from calculus and statistics to equation differentiation and complex analysis. </p>
    <p>Good sciences base. Like all engineers, I have basic knowledge of chemistry and physics that allow me easily find what I need to know when my own knowledge is insufficient.</p>
    <p>Work experience. Participation to my university's cooperative teaching program allowed me to gain work experience as I was attending school. </p>
    <h3><a name="languages"></a>Programming Languages </h3>
    <p>My university and personal studies coupled with my work experience exposed me to a variety of programming languages.</p>
    <p><strong>VHDL</strong>: Though I learned VHDL in my VLSI class, I only really because comfortable with it from participation to my 4th year university project: <a href="projects/yare/index.html">YARE</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Java</strong>: A few Java classes as well as involvement in the <a href="projects/irate/index.html">iRATE Radio</a> open source project made me an efficient Java programmer. </p>
    <p><strong>C/C++</strong>: I was introduced to C/C++ programming through my university's CSI classes. I am currently working on a GTK+ project to further my knowledge of C. </p>
    <p><strong>HT/HP Basic</strong>: Having already leaned BASIC at a young age, I had no problem adapting to HT/HP Basic for my work at NavCanada. </p>
    <p><strong>Visual Basic</strong>: Programming language learned in high school. I use it from time to time when I need a quick-and-dirty program. </p>
    <p><strong>UnrealScript</strong>: The Unreal Engine programming language. I was exposed to this language through my work for <a href="projects/tactical-ops/index.html">Tactical-Ops</a> and <a href="projects/damnation/index.html">Damnation</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Perl</strong>: A simple and powerful scripting language that I use whenever I need a script under Linux. </p>
    <p><strong>Assembler</strong>: Used thorough a few of my computer engineering classes. I have used it to program on Intel 8085 and Motorola 68HC12 processors and micro-controllers. I also programmed assembler for the PIC12F675 of my <a href="projects/xboxremote/index.html">Xbox Remote Add-on</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>MATLAB</strong>: Not really a programming language, but I will list it here anyway. I used this tool extensively through my 4 years of university studies. My <a href="projects/robotics/index.html">robotics project</a> was written entirely with MATLAB. </p>

	<h3><a name="personal"></a>Personal Studies</h3>
	<p><strong>Linux</strong>: A few years ago I started experimenting with the free operating system GNU/Linux. Back then, my roommate and I were using it as an internet gateway. Since then I have been exploring the Debian distributions. Initially I was using it on a second computer to experiment with. Now both my workstation and my server are running the Debian distribution.</p>
	<p><strong>Perl</strong>: As a side-effect of using Linux, I started learning Perl. Perl is a very developed scripting language that uses a C++/Java-like syntax. Whenever I need to write a script to do anything from DNS updates to mass file renaming, I turn to Perl.</p>
	<p><strong>UnrealScript and UnrealEd</strong>: In the summer of 2000, I started experimenting with the UnrealEd map editing software. My initial goal was to create an online replica of my university campus. As I was getting more knowledgeable with the editor, I started to learn the UnrealScript programming language used in Unreal games. Around that time I got involved with the Tactical-Ops team, eventually producing code and maps that would be used in a retail game. </p>
