      <p> Simply put, I am Mathieu Mallet. I was raised in a small town in the north-eastern part of New-Brunswick: Saint-Simon. That town is a few minutes drive away from the city of <a href="http://www.ville.caraquet.nb.ca/">Caraquet</a>. The main industries of the region are fishin and tourism. </p>
      <p>During my time at the local high-school, my interests were mostly in science and technology. I was involved in various clubs, including the school journal, the chess club and the trivia game club. I graduated from the Louis-Maillous high-school in 1999, after which I moved to Ottawa to pursue <a href="knowledge.html">post-secondary</a> studies. </p>
      <p>At the University of Ottawa, I begun a baccalaureate degree in Computer Engineering with Cooperative Education option. Since the semesters would alternate between courses and work terms, the program took four years and a half to complete. I was awarded a few admission scholarships, including the Nortel Networks scholarship and the academic excellence award. Even though my studies are now complete, I remain in Ottawa as I think the job opportunities here are better than in the Maritimes. </p>

	  <p>Ever since I started going to university on roller-blades instead of by bus, I have been an avid practitioner of the sport. During summers, I do a minimum of 45 minutes of it every day. I also do some cycling from time to time as well as some kayaking. During winters, I play in-doors floor hockey weekly. </p>
	  <p>In my free time, I enjoy both playing and developing video games. While I was in university, I worked on the <a href="projects/tactical-ops/index.html">Tactical-Ops</a> mod for which I created a few maps and a single player mission pack. I have also created a <a href="projects/xboxremote/index.html">mod for the Xbox console</a> which allows the user to power-up his console using a remote control. You can learn more about my <a href="projects/index.html">projects</a> from the page of the same name. </p>
