Required components for Xbox Remote Add-on:

Microcontroller:
 1x PIC12F629 or PIC12F675 microcontroller from Microchip

 Optional: 1x 8-pin chip socket

IR Receiver:
 1x 38KHz IR Receiver module, operating at both 3.3V and 5V (I used the TSOP34838 from Vishay-Telefunken)

Connectors (optional, the wires can be directly soldered on the board)
 2x 4-pin molex connector housing
 2x 4-pin right angle headers
 Crimp terminals for molex connector (at least 20)
 3x low-voltage wire taps (e.g. part #64-3053 from radioshack)

Misc components:
 1x 2-bit 1 position (4 pin) dip-switches
 2x 470 Ohm resistance
 1x 4.7 kOhm resistance
 1x 0.1 mF capacitor
 1x Rectifier diode
 1x LED
 1x perforated board 
 Solder
